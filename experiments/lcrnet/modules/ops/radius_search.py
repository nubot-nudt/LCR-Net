    r"""Computes neighbors for a batch of q_points and s_points, apply radius search (in stack mode).

    This function is implemented on CPU.

    Args:
        q_points (Tensor): the query points (N, 3)
        s_points (Tensor): the support points (M, 3)
        q_lengths (Tensor): the list of lengths of batch elements in q_points
        s_lengths (Tensor): the list of lengths of batch elements in s_points
        radius (float): maximum distance of neighbors
        neighbor_limit (int): maximum number of neighbors

    Returns:
        neighbors (Tensor): the k nearest neighbors of q_points in s_points (N, k).
            Filled with M if there are less than k neighbors.
