# Fast and Accurate Deep Loop Closing and Relocalization for Reliable LiDAR SLAM

We propose LCR-Net to tackle both LiDAR-based loop closing and relocalization. 
It exploits novel feature extraction and a pose-aware attention mechanism to precisely estimate similarities and 6-DoF poses between pairs of LiDAR scans. 

LCR-Net has been integrated into SLAM systems and achieves robust and accurate online LiDAR SLAM in outdoor driving environments. 

The code is coming soon!
