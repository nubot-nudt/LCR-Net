# Fast and Accurate Deep Loop Closing and Relocalization for Reliable LiDAR SLAM

We propose LCR-Net to tackle both tasks effectively. It exploits novel feature extraction and a pose-aware attention mechanism to precisely estimate similarities and 6-DoF poses between pairs of LiDAR scans. 
LCR-Net has been into SLAM systems and achieves robust and accurate online LiDAR SLAM in outdoor driving environments.
